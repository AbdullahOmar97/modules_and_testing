# Modules and Testing

This project is a lab exercise focusing on modules and testing in Python. It includes implementations of factorial functions and a function for calculating a "clumsy" factorial, along with corresponding unit tests.

## Project Structure

The project follows the following structure:


## Factorial Module

The `factorial_module.py` file in the `factorial` module contains three functions:
- `factorial_iterative(n)`: Computes the factorial of a positive integer `n` using an iterative approach.
- `factorial_recursion(n)`: Computes the factorial of a positive integer `n` using a recursive approach.
- `clumsy(n)`: Computes the "clumsy" factorial of a positive integer `n`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory of the project:
